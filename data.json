    "While working at Telefónica Perú, I faced a significant challenge: the company was burdened by immense technical debt, with systems siloed by a legacy mainframe controlling billing. This made innovation nearly impossible, as departments operated in isolation, and crucial processes were managed through inefficient tools like email and Excel. Specifically, in the presales and implementation teams, the process of designing and deploying connectivity solutions, such as integrating Networking, Security and Collaboration devices with B2B customer's premises, was chaotic and slow. The disjointed nature of the tools and systems meant that critical information was often lost or miscommunicated, leading to delays and errors. To address this, I took the initiative to implement an automated management system within Salesforce. I adopted Agile principles and adopted Scrumban to fit our needs, creating a hybrid agile process where team leaders acted as both Product Owners and Project Managers. This allowed them to focus on innovation through Design Thinking framework instead of communication, the teams became self managed. This implementation in Salesforce not only improved the efficiency of the teams but also helped to eliminate many of the manual processes that were contributing to the technical debt. The result was a more agile and cohesive workflow, which allowed the company to better handle complex projects and respond more quickly to market demands.",
